# Example Zola Book Site

I set this repo up as an exercise to learn how to use [Zola][zola] to build simple static websites with sectional navigation.

To use this template, fork the repo and your content to the `content` directory.

The hardest part of building this was setting up the [footer navigation links][nav].

The [stylesheet](static/style.css) is crude and loosely inspired by [Butterick's Practical Typography][pt], as I use a similar basic site template to build personal reference material websites.
